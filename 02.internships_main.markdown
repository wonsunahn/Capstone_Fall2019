## Your responsibilities

You have three responsibilities this term:

1. Give a 5 minute presentation on the work that you did during your internship or directed research.  Because you have limited time, you will probably need no more than 5 slides.

2. Write a 8 - 12 page paper on your internship experience and hand it in by the last day of class (6 DECEMBER).  For details, see [Final Paper]({{site.baseurl}}/final_paper) on this website.  The paper should be sent by email to our TA Arun Balajiee (arl122 at pitt dot edu) by midnight of 6 DECEMBER.  Please use a title that looks like "Capstone Final Report" where Joe is your name.

3. Fill in an anonymous peer review form for 5 presentations assigned to you.  Please use the [Peer Review Form]({{site.baseurl}}/internships/review_form.txt) on this website.  The form should be submitted to courseweb by the midnight of the presentation (Friday midnight).  The median score from the peer review forms will be used as a data point to grade the presentations.  

4. CS 1950 directed research students are responsible for maintaining a [github](https://github.com) repository for the code that they are writing.  You should add your research advisor and me as collaborators (my github ID is wonsunahn).  You should do regular commits of your work, at least on a bi-weekly basis.  Your github will be used to track your progress by both me and your advisor.

## Presentation organization (IMPORTANT)

1. The doodle poll is over.  The finalized schedule is [at this page]({{site.baseurl}}/internship_presentation_schedule).
2. Please review [the lecture on presentations]({{site.baseurl}}/lectures/Capstone_Lecture4_Presentations.pdf) and [the peer review form]({{site.baseurl}}/internships/review_form.txt) before giving your presentation.  The review form will remind you of what you are being assessed on.
3. Presenters must submit their presentation slides to courseweb the day before, by Thursday midnight.  The plan is to have your slide files ready on the in-class computer so that we can transition faster between presentations.  The preferred format is PDF or Powerpoint.  If you plan to use other presentation software, you are responsible for bringing your laptop and any adapters to connect to the classroom A/V system.  Please note that the classroom A/V system only allows HDMI connections.
