A Capstone Experience in the CS Department is one of three courses: CS 1980, CS 1900 and CS 1950. In addition to the individual requirements of each of these courses, associated with each are also required weekly meetings. During these meetings students will present their work and will also attend several guest lectures.

## Who needs it? 	

All computer science majors are required to complete a Capstone Experience prior to graduation.

## Why? 	

* Students are given the opportunity to apply their newly gained knowledge in the field of Computer Science to a non-trivial, real-world project, either in industry or research
* Students are able to see and discuss each otherâ€™s work, thereby showing them the diversity of areas in the field of Computer Science
* Students gain experience in presenting before an informed audience and in answering questions about their work
* Students gain experience in technical writing
