## Details on Internship Assignments

You have two main responsibilities this term:

1. Schedule a presentation on the work that you did during your internship.  Do this by filing an issue on this repository (click on Issues then "New Issue") with your TOP THREE choices of which date to give your presentation.  Possible presentation dates [can be found following this link]({{site.baseurl}}/internship_presentation_schedule) in this website.  Note you must select a date where INTERNSHIP presentations occur, NOT "RESEARCH" presentations.  You MUST schedule a presentation date by noon on THIS TUESDAY (3 SEPTEMBER) .  REMEMBER TO ADD "INTERNSHIP" TO THE BEGINNING OF YOUR ISSUE TITLE!

2. Write a 8 - 12 page paper on your internship experience and hand it in by the last day of class (6 DECEMBER).  For details, see [Final Paper]({{site.baseurl}}/final_paper) in this website.
