What are the students' deliverables? The students are required to give two presentations (5-min for individual projects, 7 minutes for group projects). The first one, 2-4 weeks into the term, describes their project and the goals they want to accomplish. The final presentation (during finals week) describes what was accomplished. The students are also responsible for writing up a proposal (due in the third week of classes) and a final report (in the last 2-3 weeks of classes). Lastly, students should give a demo (if appropriate) of their work.

What should the proposal consist of?  The 2-3 page (11-pt Times font, 1" margins) proposal follow approximately these guidelines:
     1-paragraph introduction of background/context
     1-paragraph problem statement/definition (what will be done/solved)
     A list of steps/tasks to be carried out to solve said problem, and the dependencies among these steps (e.g., collect data by 2/15, write scripts to parse the data by 2/19, learn D3 for visualization by 2/24, ....)  some people prefer to list the steps/tasks in a graph with arches showing the dependencies.
     3 milestones (every 4 weeks)
     For groups, how each team members will contribute, how the group will meet to coordinate, what tools will be used; 1 proposal per team if large overlap among team members, or 1 per team memberif mostly disjoint work.
     If necessary, describe how to get information from clients/outsiders (think about what you will do if they are not responsive)
Mentors are supposed to be in the loop (read the proposed plan and approve it), then the proposal is sent to me by email or hardcopy.





# CS CAPSTONE
Spring Semester 2019

## FINAL PAPER

This final paper is required for all students in the Capstone, including internship (CS 1900) and research (CS 1950) students.

## FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS

The paper must be 8 - 12 pages in length, double-spaced, using a relatively standard font and point size (e.g., 12-point Times New Roman or Computer Modern).  Judicious use of charts, graphs, and/or illustrations is acceptable.  Margins should be of standard size.

Please ensure that your name as well as the name of the project you worked on is listed, along with your faculty advisor (whoever signed your Faculty Learning Agreement, or your research advisor).

If you had an internship, you must turn in an individual paper; if in a group, please turn in a group paper.

## DETAILS

The final paper should describe what you did for the capstone, and how you did it.  This will obviously vary dramatically based on if you did a research project, a Project Studio project, an internship, etc.  Thus, it is difficult to give a broad-enough description of what is required for all of these.  Consider the following as a list of possible topics to discuss, not as a checklist.

1. What programming language did you use?  Why?
2. Were there things about the choice of language you liked?  Disliked?
3. What frameworks did you use?
4. How did you handle clarifying requirements?
5. What technical problems did you face?
6. How did you ensure quality code?
7. What kind of testing did you do?
8. What was the development process like?
9. How did you communicate with other developers/testers/customers/etc?
10. Did you have non-technical problems that you had to face?
11. What were the biggest challenges you faced during the capstone?
12. Were you able to take what you learned during the capstone and apply it to classes?  Conversely, were you able to use what you learned in class for the capstone project?
13. How did you design the software you were writing?
14. Did you present the project to customers?  How did you plan for it?
15. What was day-to-day life like?
16. Did you have a mentor?  What did they teach you?
17. What was the worst part of the capstone project?
18. How did you deal with ambiguity in requirements or direction?
19. Did you learn any interesting skills during the capstone project?

In general, what I would like to see is a good understanding of what you did, and what you learned, doing the work for the capstone.  If you worked on anything sensitive (e.g., for a government contractor or private data for a company), you do not need to refer to it in your write-up.  If there is any doubt, you may wish to show your supervisor the paper so that they may review it before turning it in.
