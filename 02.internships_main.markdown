## Your responsibilities

You have three responsibilities this term:

1. Give a 5 minute presentation on the work that you did during your internship or directed research.  Because you have limited time, you will probably need no more than 5 slides.

2. Write a 8 - 12 page paper on your internship experience and hand it in by the last day of class (6 DECEMBER).  For details, see [Final Paper]({{site.baseurl}}/final_paper) in this website.

## Presentation Organization (IMPORTANT PLEASE READ)

1. CS 1900 internship students must schedule a presentation date on this [DOODLE POLL](https://doodle.com/poll/fwbkupkkwrbznu5a) until next FRIDAY (6 SEPTEMBER).  You are to enter your name and select a single preferred date.  There are 9 slots per day and if the slots fill up, you will have to choose another day.  It is first come first serve so if you want a particular date, please sign up as early as possible.

2. CS 1950 directed research students will give their presentations on the last date of class 6 DECEMBER.  Please DO NOT participate in the doodle poll.

3. Presenters must send their presentation slides to me by email (wahn at pitt dot edu) the day before, by Thursday midnight.  Please use a title that looks like "CS 1900 slides 9/13", where 9/13 should be replaced by your respective dates.  The plan is to have your slide files ready on my laptop so that we can transition faster between presentations.  I have Powerpoint, Keynote, and PDF presentation software installed on my laptop.  If you plan to use other presentation software, you are responsible for bringing your laptop and any adapters to connect to the classroom A/V system.  Another option is to simply convert it to PDF and have it run on my laptop.
